# Minecraft Portable

A nice portable minecraft client written in java to bypass Mac OS X parental controls and to be even more portable.

An example config is located in the data folder.
Currently 1.7.3 and up sounds and other stuff does not work as I have not implemented the indexes that minecraft uses to locate the resources without relying on the assets/virtual/legacy folder.
